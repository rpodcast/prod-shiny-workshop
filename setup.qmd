We are excited to have you join us for our two-day workshop on building production-quality Shiny applications! The format of the workshop will be a mix of presentation slides, example Shiny applications, and hands-on exercises. To ensure you are ready for the journey, please review the following logistics and instructions:

### Logistics

Each day of the workshop will start at 9 AM and end at 5 PM, with multiple coffee breaks and a lunch break throughout. I will be presenting the majority of the content, but we have an amazing collection of five teaching assistants ready to assist with any technical issues or questions. All materials for the course will be viewable online at [shinyprod.com](https://shinyprod.com) and hosted on GitHub at [github.com/rstudio-conf-2022/shiny-prod-apps](https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2022/shiny-prod-apps). We also have a [discussion board](https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2022/shiny-prod-apps/discussions) within the GitHub repository available for collaboration on questions and issues. Also, be aware that the workshop materials are in active development, so please check back to the site and GitHub repository regularly before the workshop. We plan on sending additional emails as we get closer to the workshop dates.

### Assumptions

This workshop assumes you have intermediate knowledge of Shiny application development. Specifically, that you have familiarity with the concepts of reactivity and binding inputs to outputs. If you consider yourself a beginner with Shiny, the material in this workshop may be difficult to follow during the two days. If you intended to enroll in a  workshop geared towards an introduction to Shiny, please contact RStudio to see if you can switch to the **Getting Started with Shiny** workshop led by Colin Rundel.

### Setup and Requirements

1. You will need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account for key sections of this course. If you already have an account, you should be all set and no further action is needed. If you do not, creating an account is free. While version control itself is not a major focus of the course, we will discuss how certain elements can play an important role in application development and deployment. A great resource for getting a basic familiarity with Git version control is Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html) online book (also freely available).
1. RStudio will provide a dedicated workspace for this course on the [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) platform. This can be run directly from a web browser, and all system and R dependencies will be configured already. However, if you wish to use your local laptop to participate, you will need the following:

     * R version 4.1.3 or later. 
     * Your preferred integrated development environment for R, such as [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [R Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r).
     * The [`{renv}`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) package to manage package dependencies for the workshop. 
     * The Git version control system. For installation instructions on each OS, please see the [Install Git](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) chapter from Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html).
